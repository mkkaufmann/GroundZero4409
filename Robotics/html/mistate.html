        <p class="container" id="article">In 2017, Michigan FIRST Robotics Finals expanded to include the top 160 teams in the state (out of 455 registered teams!). This necessitated a move to larger facilities that could accommodate all of those robots, pits, students, mentors, judges, fans, tools, practice fields, and competition fields! Saginaw Valley State University hosted these finals from Wednesday, April 12th through Saturday, April 15th. There were four competition fields, each with 40 teams competing in District fashion. Then the winners on each field would compete against each other for the title of State Champion!
            <br><br> Ground Zero entered its first State Finals in Saginaw with high hopes! Our robot had been competing strongly and we fully expected to compete in our field finals. We did win several qualifying matches, but then experienced some field connectivity issues that caused our robot to stall. After repeated diagnostics with judges and mentors, we could not find anything wrong with our robot; however, the problem continued. When our robot worked, it was amazing! It was zipping across the field, delivering gears and climbing quickly. Unfortunately, repeated stalls mean that captains will not choose your robot to form an alliance.
            <br><br> Although we weren't able to advance past the State level, we are very proud of our team's efforts in making it to State, and in holding our heads high and doing our best at all times. Sometimes we learn the best lessons when things don't work out as we had planned. We are going to take what we have learned and apply it toward an even more amazing 2018 FIRST Robotics season for Ground Zero!</p>
