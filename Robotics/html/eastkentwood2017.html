        <p class="container" id="article">Between District Competitions, teams are allowed to unbag their robot for a total of only six hours. We decided that we should change our robot's gear mechanism from a receiving chute to a more complex claw system that could pick gears up from the ground. This was quite a challenge but our team worked together and was able to make it happen in the given time! When we arrived at East Kentwood District Competition on Thursday, March 30th and tried out our gear grabber during a practice match, it only needed a little tweaking in the pits.
            <br><br> Our robot was a strong competitor throughout the East Kentwood matches. It moved quickly and was able to pick up gears from the ground and place them on the steamship's pegs. It could also consistently climb the rope at the end of each match. In addition, we perfected our autonomous programming and control functions to place a gear on the center peg every time! These improvements earned us a high ranking and a team captain position during alliances!
            <br><br> The efforts of our scouting came in very handing when we had to choose our partners for District finals! This data gathering and analysis enabled us to identify the teams that could complement our strengths and form the strongest possible alliance. We strove to be positive leaders as alliance captains, and we led our alliance to an exciting finish up through Semifinals on Saturday.
            <br><br> During the awards ceremony, Ground Zero was presented with the Excellence in Safety Award, thanks to the quality efforts of our Safety Captains! We were very pleased with our team's performance and were excited to see our State rankings climb. Would we qualify for our first Michigan State Finals experience? The odds looked to be in our favor!</p>
