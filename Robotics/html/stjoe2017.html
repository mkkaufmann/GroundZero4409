        <p class="container" id="article">Our first District competition in the 2017 FIRST Steamworks Robotics season was in St. Joseph, Michigan, March 9th through 11th. Like most District competitions, pits opened late afternoon on Thursday. We arrived and set up our pit and waited for a judge to unbag, inspect and approve our robot. We were very excited to try out our robot that evening on the game field during the practice matches.
            <br><br> Friday the qualifying competitions began. Forty teams from Southwest Michigan were scheduled to play each other three on three in a total of 80 qualifying matches. Friday was a long day, with 60 total matches run. The energy was amazing. A DJ played upbeat music between matches. Our robot did well but had some stalling issues which we worked hard to fix in our pit in between matches. We worked on programming autonomous functions to gain extra points at the beginning of each match.
            <br><br> Saturday was a very exciting day. The final twenty qualifying matches were held in the morning. By lunchtime, the final total scores were in. The top eight teams got to choose alliances for District Finals in the afternoon. This meant that only 24 of the 40 teams would get to compete in finals - 8 alliances, each made up of three teams, and each vying for the prestigious title of District Champion!
            <br><br> Our team was not one of the top eight, but we were ecstatic to be invited into a finals alliance with the BOB team (85) and the Buc'n'Gears (3546). We really enjoyed this alliance because all the teams had great attitudes, valued each other's contributions, and never gave up! Each finals round was the best two out of three. We made it through Quarterfinals and a very exciting Semi-Finals where we showed our ability to play defense. Soon we advanced to the Finals against one other Alliance! Although we didn't win, we were very proud to finish our first 2017 District Competition with finalist medals! </p>
